##QR
The qrcode.py file gets the sarting id like "1" as input and generates 160 qrimages of the string "KQ160001" in png. For example : if the input is "100", 160 files from "KQ160100" to "KQ160259 " will be generated.

The qrcode.py file takes the starting id like "1" as input and decodes the qr images and prints the generated data.

The makeImage.py file takes the files and makes another file which contains all the images in it.
